What I learned today:

* Hilbert's Nullstellensatz (Artin Ch.11.8.6): Maximal ideals in C[x_1,x_2,...,x_n] are in bijective correspondence with points in C^n. This is the starting point of Algebraic Geometry: algebraic property of C[x]/I is closely related to the geometric properties of V (algebraic variety).
* Notes on Representation Theory by Max Steinberg (UCLA Math '24), tried to understand waht quivers and McKay correspondence are. Quivers look very alike to a category from my understanding, and the McKay correspondence classifies all the finite subgroups (symmetries) of SU(2) (In bijection with ADE quivers).
