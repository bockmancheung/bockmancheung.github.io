Lec 1: ABS

246A: Complex Analysis (Terence Tao)
---
Lec 1: Complex Numbers as an extension field of the reals; as a quotient of the real polynomial ring. Existence of the complex field by Argend plane construction.

Best joke of the day: Terry Tao imagining himself explaining real numbers to aliens, and he said, " I will leave you all the axioms there, and just trust me bro (that real numbers exist)".

Lec 2: Proving the existence of complex numbers by showing that the quotient construction of the real polynomial ring is a field, and some simple complex arithmetic.

Slightly disappointed because it is supposed to be a graudate class but so far everything is too simple.
