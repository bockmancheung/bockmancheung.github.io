What I learned today:
------

* Classifying Compact Riemann surfaces (vanishing locus of f: C^2 -> C^2) as a n-sheeted branch covering space (every fibre consists of n points, and every neighborhood on the points of fibre homeomorphic to open neighborhood of the image).

12/19
* Hilbert's Nullstellensatz (Artin Theorem 11.8.6): Maximal ideals in C[x_1,x_2,...,x_n] are in bijective correspondence with points in C^n. This is the starting point of Algebraic Geometry: algebraic property of C[x]/I is closely related to the geometric properties of V (algebraic variety).
* <a href="https://max.steinbergfour.com/files/reptheory.pdf"> Notes on Representation Theory by Max Steinberg (UCLA Math '24) </a>, had a taste on what quivers and McKay correspondence are. Quivers look very alike to a category from my understanding, and the McKay correspondence classifies all the finite subgroups (symmetries) of SU(2) (In bijection with ADE quivers).
