Summer 2023 
------
(Summer classes are usually more compact than regular quarter classes as there are only 6 weeks to cover 10 weeks of material, so especially for math, only take them in summer when you prepare enough.)

***Math 131A Real Analysis***, Instructor: Prof. F. Scavia <br>
Overall rating: 8/10 <br>
Topics covered: Roughly what a standard analysis course would cover, without point-set topology and modes of convergence.

Prof. Scavia was a solid teacher. He had a very clear direction for where the class was going and handled the class pace quite well, covering all the materials by the end of the second week, so we could have one week of time to revise for the final. This was extremely important and helpful for the smooth running of a class, especially in the summer session with such a tight paced interval. He also had good teaching skills, as he explained the concept fairly concisely and in detail with visible handwriting. The difficulty of the midterm exam was quite reasonable, so those who prepared enough could really get a high score, and he did curve generously.

I should have taken 131AH, the honors version of the class, but it wasn't offered over the summer, so I took the non-honors version instead. The motive of taking the class was to demonstrate my ability in math, so I could skip calculus (I don't have any credits because HKDSE isn't recognized in the UC system) and take advanced upper divs.
