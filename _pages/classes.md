Summer 2023 
------

**Math 131A**, Instructor: Prof. F. Scavia <br>
Overall rating: 8/10 <br>
Comment: Prof. Scavia was a solid teacher. He had a very clear direction for where the class was going and handled the class pace quite well, covering all the materials by the end of the second week, so we could have one week of time to revise for the final. This was extremely important and helpful for the smooth running of a class, especially in the summer session with such a tight paced interval. He also had good teaching skills, as he explained the concept fairly concisely and in detail with visible handwriting. The difficulty of the midterm exam was quite reasonable, so those who prepared enough could really get a high score, and he did curve generously. Overall, I am satisfied with Prof. Scavia but I won't recommend students who are not mathematically mature enough to take the class without getting sufficiently prepared, as it is very easy to get behind, for example, by not understanding the material in the middle chapters a week before the finals.
