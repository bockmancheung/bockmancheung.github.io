Welcome to my personal webpage! I am Bockman Cheung, a first year UCLA math undergraduate. My current interests in learning are algebraic topology and functional analysis. I am also a human rights activist, environmental advocate, and an amateur musician. 

Mathematics
------
Please check out (but also take as a grain of salt) my review of the classes I have taken in /classes/ , including but not limited to teaching quality, grading, and difficulty of the content. 

Recommended beginner resources to learn Abstract algebra:

Algebra Ch.0, Aluffi <br>
Algebra, Artin <br>
Algebra, Dummit and Foote <br>

Music
------
My major instrument is the piano, I have been playing and learning it for over a decade. Last fall quarter I collaborated with percussionist Viraj Sonawala on Fiddle Faddle by Leroy Anderson in Bruin Chamber Musicians, and that has been one of my favorite moments so far.
