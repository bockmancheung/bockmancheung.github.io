My Background
======

As you can already guess from my first romanticized Cantonese first name, I am from Hong Kong, and I spent my first 17 years of life there. It is a place that combines Chinese and Western culture, and its beauty lies not only in the breathtaking skylines, but also in the fact that there is so much to discover on just one street and building. I can speak Cantonese, English and Mandarin in a native level.
