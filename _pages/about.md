Welcome to Bockman Cheung's homepage! I'm an aspiring mathematician and a second year math undergraduate at UCLA. 

Academic Focus
------
I'm interested in Algebraic Geometry, Class Field Theory, and Riemannian Geometry. 

In pedestrian's terms, Algebraic Geometry studies solutions of systems of equations, Class Field Theory seeks to describe a class of "nice" (abelian Galois) extensions of fields, Riemannian Geometry is the most generalized version of Euclidean Geometry to e.g. spherical geometry (the Earth we live in!).

Tangentially interested: Algebraic Topology, Lie Theory, Representation Theory, Complex Geometry.
