Welcome to Bockman Cheung's webpage! I am a second year UCLA math undergraduate. 

Academic Focus
------
My learning interest lies in algebraic topology, computer-assisted proofs (Lean), and algebraic number theory.  <br>

Specifically, I have just taken a first course in algebraic topology and would like to pursue in the direction of cohomology and higher homotopy theory after I consolidate my foundations. In lean, I would like to learn type theory and achieve proficiency in the language so that I can do cool things like working out my algebra homework in the computer. In algebraic number theory, I am planning to look into the theory of local fields and p-adic numbers.

Great resources for first year Algebra <br>
* Algebra, Artin <br>

* Algebra, Lang <br>
* <a href="https://mathoverflow.net/a/70891/517395"> Resources on Category Theory </a>

Hobbies/Committments outside of Math
