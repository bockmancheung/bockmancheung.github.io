Welcome to my personal webpage! I am Bockman Cheung, a first year undergraduate at UCLA in math. My ineterest lies in algebra, topology, and geometry. I am also a human rights activist, environmental advocate, and an amaeteur musician. 

Mathematics
------
I'm not well read enough on math to have a very specialized field of interest, but I am currently leaning towards pure math, in particular algebra. I would describe myself as a dedicated and passionate learner, and also an active participant in class, who would ask questions frequently and form study groups. Please check out (but also take as a grain of salt) my review of the classes I have taken in /classes/ , including but not limited to teaching quality, grading, and difficulty of the content. 

Some resources in Algebra I found useful:

Algebra Ch.0, Aluffi <br>
Algebra, Artin <br>
Algebra, Dummit and Foote <br>

Music
------
My major instrument is the piano, I have been playing and learning it for over a decade. Last fall quarter I collaborated with percussionist Viraj Sonawala on Fiddle Faddle by Leroy Anderson in Bruin Chamber Musicians, and that has been one of my favorite moments so far.
