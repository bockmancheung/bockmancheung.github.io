Welcome to my personal webpage! I am Bockman Cheung, a first year UCLA math undergraduate. I am also a human rights activist, environmental advocate, and an amateur musician/concert goer. 

Mathematics
------
I'm interested in general abstract nonsense, but I'd love to look more into the analysis/dynamical systems side.

Resources I find most useful in a first course of algebra:
Algebra, Artin <br>
<a href="https://canvas.ust.hk/courses/50980"> HKUST Math 5111 Notes </a>
Algebra, Lang
<a href="https://mathoverflow.net/a/70891/517395"> Resources on Category Theory (towards infty cat) </a>

Music
------
My major instrument is the piano, I have been playing and learning it for over a decade. Last fall quarter I collaborated with percussionist Viraj Sonawala on Fiddle Faddle by Leroy Anderson in Bruin Chamber Musicians, and that has been one of my favorite moments so far. 

Daily Bruin
------
I write for Daily Bruin as an opinion columnist, and I focus on campus issues. You can check out my works <a href="https://dailybruin.com/author/bockman-cheung"> here </a>. In the future, I would like to look for opportunities related to communication in sciences to the public.
