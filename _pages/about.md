Welcome to Bockman Cheung's webpage! I am a first year UCLA math undergraduate. Outside of math, I am most involved in supporting the cause of Palestian struggles and workers' rights (activism), piano playing (my interest lies in Bach and Beethoven, and I am also looking into modern/contemporary music such as Schoenberg recently), and writing (opinion articles and journalism).

Academic Focus
------
I'm interested in learning homotopy theory (higher algebra), algebraic geometry, and various cohomology theories througout mathematics. In one year from now (i.e. by the end of sophmore year), I would like to see myself understanding the basics of those. <br> 

Great resources a first course in Modern Algebra <br>
* Algebra, Artin <br>
* <a href="https://canvas.ust.hk/courses/50980"> HKUST Math 5111 Notes </a> <br>
* Algebra, Lang <br>
* <a href="https://mathoverflow.net/a/70891/517395"> Resources on Category Theory </a>

My inbox is always open to questions/information sharing.

Music
------
My instrument is piano, and I occasionally perform classical music and go to classical concerts. 

I am involved in Bruin Chamber Musicians, a chamber music club for non-music majors. My performances in UCLA: <br>
* Yukiko Nishimura, Myraid of Stars, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrdK84jvPcg&list=PLwzikTIanNz2S2H5xbVAPMi1RYJ1Gc3W5&index=2"> I. Starry Heaven </a><br> Percussionist: Viraj Sonawala, Winter 2024.

Daily Bruin
------
I write for Daily Bruin as an opinion columnist, and I focus on campus issues. In the future, I would like to look for opportunities related to communication in sciences to the public. My list of articles: <br>
