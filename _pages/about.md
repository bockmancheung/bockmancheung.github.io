Welcome to Bock-Man Cheung's webpage! I am a first year UCLA math undergraduate. Outside of math, I am most involved in supporting the cause of Palestian struggles and workers' rights (activism), piano playing (my interest lies in Bach and Beethoven, and I am also looking into modern/contemporary music such as Schoenberg recently), and writing (opinion articles and journalism).

Mathematics Interests
------
I'm interested in general algebraic topology and algebraic geometry. It is really amazing to see how (co)homology comes up everywhere, from singular cohomology to sheaf cohomology, and to grid homology of knots. <br> 

To get started in what I am interested in right now, I suggest first getting a solid background in algebra: <br>
* Algebra, Artin <br>
* <a href="https://canvas.ust.hk/courses/50980"> HKUST Math 5111 Notes </a> <br>
* Algebra, Lang <br>
* <a href="https://mathoverflow.net/a/70891/517395"> Resources on Category Theory </a>

If you would like to need advice on math classes and math learning, you can email me. I would love to connect with you and answer your questions.

Music
------
My instrument is piano, and I occasionally perform classical music and go to classical concerts. 

I am involved in Bruin Chamber Musicians, a chamber music club for non-music majors. My performances in UCLA: <br>
* Yukiko Nishimura, Myraid of Stars, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrdK84jvPcg&list=PLwzikTIanNz2S2H5xbVAPMi1RYJ1Gc3W5&index=2"> I. Starry Heaven </a><br> Percussionist: Viraj Sonawala, Winter 2024.
* Leroy Anderson, <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jEOYYdv9ud3tySmvCltWasAuPfBAbL8W/view?usp=sharing"> Fiddle Faddle </a><br> Percussionist: Viraj Sonawala, Fall 2023.


Daily Bruin
------
I write for Daily Bruin as an opinion columnist, and I focus on campus issues. In the future, I would like to look for opportunities related to communication in sciences to the public. My list of articles: <br>
* <a href="https://dailybruin.com/2024/02/26/opinion-improving-the-state-of-pianos-on-the-hill-is-the-key-to-student-well-being"> Opinion: Improving the state of pianos on the Hill is the key to student well-being </a>
