Welcome to my personal academic webpage! My name is Bockman Cheung, and I am a first year undergraduate at UCLA in math. I am currently leaning towards pure math, but I am also interested in learning about their applications. I am also a political and environmental advocate, as I look forward to joining the UCLA community to help fight against social issues and the climate crisis. 

My Background
======

As you can already guess from my romanticized Cantonese first name, I am from Hong Kong, and I spent my first 17 years of life there. It is a place that combines Chinese and Western culture, and its beauty lies not only in the breathtaking skylines, but also in the fact that there is so much to discover on just one street and building. I can speak Cantonese, English and Mandarin in a native level.
