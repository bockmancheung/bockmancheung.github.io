Welcome to my personal webpage! I am Bockman Cheung, a first year UCLA math undergraduate. Outside of Math, I am very involved in supporting the cause of Palestian struggles (activism), and piano playing (my interest lies in Bach and Beethoven, and I am also looking into modern/contemporary music such as Schoenberg recently).

Mathematics
------
I'm interested in general abstract nonsense (algebraic topology/algebraic geometry), but I'd love to look into the analysis side. 

Resources I find most useful for a first course in algebra: <br>
* Algebra, Artin <br>
* <a href="https://canvas.ust.hk/courses/50980"> HKUST Math 5111 Notes </a> <br>
* Algebra, Lang <br>
* <a href="https://mathoverflow.net/a/70891/517395"> Resources on Category Theory </a>

If you would like to need advice on math classes and math learning, you can email me. I would love to connect with you and answer your questions.

Music
------
My instrument is piano, and I am very involved in performing classical music and going to classical concerts. Very fun hobby I am grateful of my parents.

I am involved in Bruin Chamber Musicians, a chamber music club for non-music majors. My performances in UCLA: <br>
* Yukiko Nishimura, Myraid of Stars, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrdK84jvPcg&list=PLwzikTIanNz2S2H5xbVAPMi1RYJ1Gc3W5&index=2"> I. Starry Heaven </a><br> Percussionist: Viraj Sonawala, Winter 2024.
* Leroy Anderson, <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jEOYYdv9ud3tySmvCltWasAuPfBAbL8W/view?usp=sharing"> Fiddle Faddle </a><br> Percussionist: Viraj Sonawala, Fall 2023.


Daily Bruin
------
I write for Daily Bruin as an opinion columnist, and I focus on campus issues. In the future, I would like to look for opportunities related to communication in sciences to the public. My list of articles: <br>
* <a href="https://dailybruin.com/2024/02/26/opinion-improving-the-state-of-pianos-on-the-hill-is-the-key-to-student-well-being"> Opinion: Improving the state of pianos on the Hill is the key to student well-being </a>
