Welcome to Bockman Cheung's webpage! I am a second year UCLA math undergraduate. 

Academic Focus
------
I'm interested in algebra and topology. Previously I was into homotopy theory, but upon reflection I'd say I'm still undecided.  <br> 

> ... mathematics is so rich and infinite that it is impossible to learn it systematically, and if you wait to master one topic before moving on to the next, you'll never get anywhere. Instead, you'll have tendrils of knowledge extending far from your comfort zone. Then you can later backfill from these tendrils, and extend your comfort zone; this is much easier to do than learning "forwards". <br>
