Welcome to my personal webpage! I am Bockman Cheung, a first year UCLA math undergraduate. I am also a human rights activist, environmental advocate, and an amateur musician/concert goer. 

Mathematics
------
I'm interested in general abstract nonsense (algebraic topology/algebraic geometry), but I'd love to look into the analysis/dynamical systems side. 

Resources I find most useful for a first course of algebra: <br>
Algebra, Artin <br>
<a href="https://canvas.ust.hk/courses/50980"> HKUST Math 5111 Notes </a> <br>
Algebra, Lang <br>
<a href="https://mathoverflow.net/a/70891/517395"> Resources on Category Theory (towards infty cat) </a>

If you would like to need advice on math classes and math learning, you can email me. I would love to connect with you and answer your questions.

Music
------
My major instrument is piano, although I'm arguably still mediocre in it. In Fall 2023, I performed with percussionist Viraj Sonawala in Bruin Chamber Musicians on a Piano-Xylophone arrangment of Leroy Anderson's <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jEOYYdv9ud3tySmvCltWasAuPfBAbL8W/view?usp=sharing"> Fiddle Faddle </a><br>. This Winter 2024 I will be performing with Viraj again on the Myraid of Stars by Yukiko Nishimura.

Daily Bruin
------
I write for Daily Bruin as an opinion columnist, and I focus on campus issues. You can check out my works <a href="https://dailybruin.com/author/bockman-cheung"> here </a>. In the future, I would like to look for opportunities related to communication in sciences to the public.
