Welcome to Bockman Cheung's webpage! I am a second year undergraduate at UCLA in math. 

Academic Focus
------
I'm interested in Algebraic Geometry, Class Field Theory, and Riemannian Geometry. 

In pedestrian's terms, Algebraic Geometry studies solutions of systems of equations, Class Field Theory seeks to describe a class of "nice" (abelian Galois) extensions of fields, Riemannian Geometry is the most generalized version of Euclidean Geometry to e.g. spherical geometry (the Earth we live in!).

Tangentially interested: Algebraic Topology, Lie Theory, Representation Theory, Complex Geometry.

Hobbies
------
* Political theories, in particular classical liberalism, socialism, and anarchism. Political Activism and Social Justice is a big part of my life.
* Classical Piano: Bach's Goldberg Variations, Chopin's Ballade No.4, and anything Bach/Romantic/Modern/Extremely modern.
* Literature: Shakespeare (9/38 plays completed!), Milton (Paradise Lost), Joyce (Ulysses), and all kinds of poetry.
