Welcome to my personal webpage! I am Bockman Cheung, a first year UCLA math undergraduate. I am also a human rights activist, environmental advocate, and an amateur musician/concert goer. 

Mathematics
------
My current learning interests are algebraic topology and functional analysis.

Personal favorite resources for Algebra:

Algebra Ch.0, Aluffi <br>
Algebra, Artin <br>
Algebra, Dummit and Foote <br>
<a href="https://canvas.ust.hk/courses/50980"> HKUST Math 5111 Notes </a>

Music
------
My major instrument is the piano, I have been playing and learning it for over a decade. Last fall quarter I collaborated with percussionist Viraj Sonawala on Fiddle Faddle by Leroy Anderson in Bruin Chamber Musicians, and that has been one of my favorite moments so far. 

Daily Bruin
------
I published my first <a href="https://dailybruin.com/2024/02/01/ucla-admin-to-end-dining-hall-restriction-for-overdue-fees"> Daily Bruin article </a>, on the ending of UCLA dining account restrictions for late payment.
