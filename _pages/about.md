Welcome to Bockman Cheung's homepage! I'm an aspiring mathematician and a third year math undergraduate at UCLA. 

Academic Focus
------
I'm learning about Algebraic Geometry and Analysis, and their applications in a range of topics in Algebraic Number Theory, Geometry, and Representation Theory. 

Message to friends
------ 
Hi, thanks for looking me up. If we know in real life and if you want to hangout, please don't hesitate to reach me out. The American culture is too isolated to my taste sometimes, and I don't like to pretend that I'm always busy. Yes, sometimes I am, but I don't overwork very much, and usually even on weekdays I'd have time out for a cup of coffee or a meal gathering. More importantly, I'm a human being who desire real and genuine connections. There're times when I feel like I need to talk to someone but every friend takes like a week to make plans with. My observation is everyone tries to control their time by calendaring every time-block, but we end up being overwhelmed and losing flexibility outside of our schedule. This is **not** the way I want my relationships to be. My fundamental rule of socializing is spontaneity. I'd even argue that making spontaneous plans is a part of **self care**. Even if you're asking me a day before or on that day you want to hangout, I'd gladly come if I have time. There're days I don't feel like it, but we can reschedule. Don't fall into the assumption that I'm always not available. *Just ask*, please. I won't think you're mean to me.
