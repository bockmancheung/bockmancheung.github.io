Welcome to Bockman Cheung's webpage! I am a second year UCLA math undergraduate. 

Academic Focus
------
I am interested in learning algebra related fields, including but not limited to algebraic topology, algebraic geometry, lie groups, algebraic number theory, representation theory, cluster algebra, and K-theory. Recently, I am into computer-assisted proofs too (Lean 4).


Great resources for first year Algebra <br>
* Algebra, Artin <br>
* <a href="https://canvas.ust.hk/courses/50980"> HKUST Math 5111 Notes </a> <br>
* Algebra, Lang <br>
* <a href="https://mathoverflow.net/a/70891/517395"> Resources on Category Theory </a>

Hobbies/Committments outside of Math
------
* Political activism (Free Palestine!) and the cause of social justice
* Bach and 20th century modernism piano pieces
* Literature: Reading Ulysses
* Journalism (Opinion Columns)
* Middle-distance Running (~10 km)
* Learning how to trill my tongue for Espa√±ol
