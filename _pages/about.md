Welcome to Bockman Cheung's webpage! I am a first year UCLA math undergraduate. Outside of math, I am most involved in supporting the cause of Palestinian struggles and labor rights, playing the piano (I'm finding myself most appreciative of Bach and Beethoven, but I am recently going into modern music too), and writing (I have a lot of opinions about the world; I like to write opinion articles and look into journalism).

Academic Focus
------
I'm interested in learning homotopy theory, higher algebra, algebraic geometry, and various cohomology theories (e.g. group cohomology, grid cohomology) throughout mathematics. In one year from now (i.e. by the end of sophmore year), I would like to see myself understanding the basics of those. <br> 

> Here's a phenomenon I was surprised to find: you'll go to talks, and hear various words, whose definitions you're not so sure about. At some point you'll be able to make a sentence using those words; you won't know what the words mean, but you'll know the sentence is correct. You'll also be able to ask a question using those words. You still won't know what the words mean, but you'll know the question is interesting, and you'll want to know the answer. Then later on, you'll learn what the words mean more precisely, and your sense of how they fit together will make that learning much easier. The reason for this phenomenon is that mathematics is so rich and infinite that it is impossible to learn it systematically, and if you wait to master one topic before moving on to the next, you'll never get anywhere. Instead, you'll have tendrils of knowledge extending far from your comfort zone. Then you can later backfill from these tendrils, and extend your comfort zone; this is much easier to do than learning "forwards". (Caution: this backfilling is necessary. There can be a temptation to learn lots of fancy words and to use them in fancy sentences without being able to say precisely what you mean. You should feel free to do that, but you should always feel a pang of guilt when you do.)

Music

My instrument is piano, and I occasionally perform classical music and go to classical concerts. 

I am involved in Bruin Chamber Musicians, a chamber music club for non-music majors. My performances in UCLA: <br>

Daily Bruin

I write for Daily Bruin as an opinion columnist, and I focus on campus issues. In the future, I would like to look for opportunities related to communication in sciences to the public. My list of articles: <br>
