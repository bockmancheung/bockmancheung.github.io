Welcome to Bockman Cheung's webpage! I am a first year UCLA math undergraduate. Outside of math, I try to participate in political activism, play the piano (I'm finding myself most appreciative of Bach and Beethoven, but I am recently going into modern music too), and write.

Academic Focus
------
I'm interested in learning homotopy theory, higher algebra, algebraic geometry, and various cohomology theories (e.g. group cohomology, grid cohomology) throughout mathematics. In one year from now (i.e. by the end of sophmore year), I would like to see myself understanding the basics of those. <br> 

> ... mathematics is so rich and infinite that it is impossible to learn it systematically, and if you wait to master one topic before moving on to the next, you'll never get anywhere. Instead, you'll have tendrils of knowledge extending far from your comfort zone. Then you can later backfill from these tendrils, and extend your comfort zone; this is much easier to do than learning "forwards". <br>

Making the Case for Pure Math
------
There is a lot of problems in the world, and only 24 hours in a day. I often am led to answer the question of how to allocate my time. After seeing the failure of society and struggling on grades and relationships last quarter, I need to answer Hamlet's question: to be or not to be in pure math? I have been wrestling with the question for at least a year - perhaps this is the "only one really serious philosophical problem", as Camus will put it. 

I honestly really hate dealing with such problems. There are no answers, and one can only answer for themselves by weighing which factor matters more in their heart. But this weighing process is usually biased as one has only a partial view of themselves. This leads to anxiety in decision making. What if I \textit{missed} something important? The nature of this question forces one to take certain propositions on faith, like those axioms in math, as their guiding principles. 

Before I talk about those axioms, I would like to clarify my definition on the term "pure math", because I know there will be a lot of debate on the usage of the term. I agree that the term is somehow abused or contaminated, just like how an average American, raised under the indoctrination of an average school, would view "socialism" or "anarchism" negatively because they naturally associated them with disorder or anti-government - those criticisms cannot be taken quite seriously - and overlooked the organizing aspect of the theory. (I am an anarchist from the Chomsky tradition, if you are wondering.) Anyways, this is my definition of pure mathematics:

* Pure math is the study of abstract mathematical objects that usually exists platonically, and does not have direct day-to-day applications in the forseeable future.

Although I don't really like to see, and I think it is impossible, to see mathematics in a binary way as "pure" or "applied", I am not here to argue about this. This should be left for philosophical readers as an exercise. I am just going to drop my definition and go straight to my point. But I cannot stress enough that under my definition of pure mathematics, probably only very few subjects apply, such as Grothendieck's Algebraic Geometry or the Riemann Hypothesis. (Note that I chose the keywords very carefully: the emphasis is on the "abstract", "direct", "day-to-day", and "forseeable".)

What are my principles in math at this point of life, as a 18-year-old averagely smart college student? I will try to argue myself to continue in doing math as below. The zeroth axiom - one that will never change regardless of age, is as below:

* Axiom 0: Math is a fundamentally humanistic subject that serves to advance understanding and build a better world.

We see mathematics exhibits humanity in a multitude of ways: math leads to the advancement of technology which, if theoretically well-employed, can be used to free people from working basic monotonic jobs. If mathematics leads to almost no applications at all or applications that will be useful very far ahead of future, one's usual argument is that we can do math for math's sake, and the inherent logic and beauty in such an organized human effort is itself appreciable in human nature. Last but not least, the tradition of mathematics teaching is very warm and welcoming that empowers students to not only to think rationally and criticially but also encourages them to identify the biases and prejudices in daily life judgement, expose structures in the world that cannot justify its existence, and tell the truth.

However, all that being said, my next axiom, or rather observation, represents a slightly cynical view at this stage of humanity:

* Axiom 1: Good societies are prone to corruption easily. Although many are doing good to the world, there is more power actively trying to ruin it.

As a remark, the reason I used "power" is that in today's America, or in most countries, most political power is concentrated in the hands of the wealthy or a small group of people. I have seen, especially in the protests this Spring, numerous unsung heroes that dedicate themselves to change, albeit the momentum is not strong enough that the struggle must still go on.

This axiom has far-reaching consequences. The most depressing corollary is the belief that, if our world is dying and most only care about their personal interests, why should I care too? However, I \textit{declare} that I reject this view. Drawing strength from existentialism and absurdism, I believe that one \textit{must} keep this last straw of false hope going - that we should rebel against nothingness, that it is on our hands that we create our own meaning.

I don't wish to take the consequences of this axiom under a negative light. Instead, I argue it follows from Axioms 0 and 1 that \textbf{there is a responsibility in studying mathematics to improve the well-being of people}. For pure mathematics it is quite impossible to improve materially, but we can use the privileges as a math-educator and as in a respectable position of society to educate the mass and advocate for change.
