Welcome to my personal academic webpage! My name is Bockman Cheung, and I am a first year undergraduate at UCLA in math. I am also a political and environmental advocate, as I look forward to joining the UCLA community to help fight against social issues and the climate crisis. I am trying to start a blog to record my learning progress, as well as my experiences in UCLA and thoughts!

Background
------
As you can already guess from my romanticized Cantonese first name （張博旻 romnatized to Cheung Bock Man）, I am from Hong Kong, and I spent my first 17 years of life there. It is a place that combines Chinese and Western culture, and its beauty lies not only in the breathtaking skylines, but also in the fact that there is so much to discover on just one street and building. I can speak Cantonese, English and Mandarin in a native level, and I am open to everyone who wants to practice Chinese!

Mathematics
------
I'm not well read enough on math to have a very specialized field of interest, but I am currently leaning towards pure math, in particular algebra. I would describe myself as a dedicated and passionate learner, and also an active participant in class, who would ask questions frequently and form study groups to learn together. You can check out my review of the classes I have taken in /classes/ , including but not limited to the quality of teaching, grading, and difficulty of the content. 

Algebra Texts I am currently reading:

Algebra Ch.0, Aluffi

Algebra, Artin

Algebra, Dummit and Foote
