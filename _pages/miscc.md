## Translating Grothendieck's EGA (to learn Math and French) <br>
Sentences might be incomplete; my rule of translation here is to convey the mathematics most closely resembling the orignial version. The preservation of literary value comes closely after that. <br>

### 1.0. Rings and Algebras (05/09/2024) <br>
(1.0.1) All the rings we consider here are assumed to be unital; all modules over some ring is supposed to contain a multiplicative identity; the ring homomorphisms are assumed to map a unital element to a unital element; unless mentioning explicitly to the contrary, an automorphism of a ring A is assumed to be fixing unital elements. We consider in most cases a commutative ring, and when we do not mention explicitly, the ring in question is assumed to be commutative. If A is a ring not necessarily commutative, the A-module is still understood as a left module, unless otherwise mentioned.
