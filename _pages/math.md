* Nilpotent Lie Algebras 

I started falling in love with the expositions of the mastero Jean-Pierre Serre. His level of concision is unmatched, and reading it feels like him standing in front of me giving me a live lecture. And also he has so many relevant books that lies right on my interest: Lie Groups and Lie Algebras, A Course in Arithmetic, Local Fields, Galois Cohomology, and much more...

* Whitney's Embedding Theorem, Smooth Approximation Theorem
* Hilbert's Theorem 90, Ring of Integers of Cyclotomic Fields
* Solving group theory problems on the Algebra Qual

I learned a new trick in checking that a group is not simple. When we exhaust all information from Sylow Theorems, we can instead look at the normalizer <math display="block" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">
  <mrow>
    <msub>
      <mi>N</mi>
      <mi>G</mi>
    </msub>
    <mrow>
      <mo stretchy="true" form="prefix">(</mo>
      <mi>P</mi>
      <mo stretchy="true" form="postfix">)</mo>
    </mrow>
  </mrow>
</math>
here, which has order 
<math display="block" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">
  <mrow>
    <mrow>
      <mo stretchy="true" form="prefix">|</mo>
      <mi>G</mi>
      <mo stretchy="true" form="postfix">|</mo>
    </mrow>
    <mi>/</mi>
    <mrow>
      <mo stretchy="true" form="prefix">|</mo>
      <mtext mathvariant="normal">orb</mtext>
      <mrow>
        <mo stretchy="true" form="prefix">(</mo>
        <mi>P</mi>
        <mo stretchy="true" form="postfix">)</mo>
      </mrow>
      <mo stretchy="true" form="postfix">|</mo>
    </mrow>
  </mrow>
</math>
and then we can apply the second isomorphism theorem and Frattini's Argument to count elements and get a contradiction. The exercise that taught me this trick is about showing that every group of order 315 is the direct product of a group of order 5 and a semidirect product of a group of order 7 and a subgroup of order 9.
