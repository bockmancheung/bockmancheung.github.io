Fall Quarter 2023 Recap
---
Math
---
I took 4 classes in this quarter - one class more than what a typical freshman would take. All 3 of my math classes (32AH, 110AH, 115AH) are honors, 2 of them upper divisions and demanded maturity with proof writing. I was a bit worried about whether I could complete them, but I somehow sticked with my schedule and clutched a good grade in my final exams.

I do not advise anyone to follow my path without sufficient preparation, for the mastery of these material requires dedication of time, but I think my act of taking these hard classes illustrated just my general attitude of studying in UCLA - craving for knowledge! UCLA is a wonderful academic institution to study math. We have objectively the best professors in the world, very helpful graduate students, and advanced and enthusiastic undergraduate students. There is simply no excuse to not to absorb knowledge greedily like a sponge. These three months were more intellectually stimulating than all of my previous 17 years of life combined. I tried to make the most of learning in my busy schedule by auditing graduate classes. I audited Prof. Balmer's 210A Algebra for 4 weeks: we went through category theory and I still have a headache when thinking of the Yoneda Lemma and (co)limit/adjoints... the hell to who invented those abstract nonsense! Prof. Tao's 246A complex analysis class was another excellent class too.
