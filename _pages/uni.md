### Exploring the Majesty of Modern Mathematics: A Very Distant View
Fall Quarter 2023

### Great Mathematical Excitement as a New Bruin
I took 4 classes in this quarter - one class more than what a typical freshman would take. All 3 of my math classes (32AH, 110AH, 115AH) were honors, 2 of them were upper divisions and demanded maturity with proof writing. Even though I was concerned about completing them, I managed to stick to my schedule and clutch my finals to get a decent grade.

I do not advise anyone to follow my path without sufficient preparation, for the mastery of these materials requires dedication of time, but I think my act of taking these hard classes illustrated just my general attitude of studying in UCLA - craving for knowledge! UCLA is a wonderful academic institution to study math. We have objectively the best professors in the world, very helpful graduate students, and advanced and enthusiastic undergraduate students. There is simply no excuse not to absorb knowledge greedily like a sponge. These three months were more intellectually stimulating than all of my previous 17 years of life combined. I tried to make the most of learning in my busy schedule by auditing graduate classes. I audited Prof. Paul Balmer's 210A Algebra for 4 weeks: we went through category theory and I still have a headache when thinking of the Yoneda Lemma and (co)limit/adjoints... the hell to who invented that abstract nonsense! That said, I do like Balmer’s lecture style, in front of the blackboard he is the artist and showman, displaying everything aesthetically. Of all professor’s boardwork I like Prof. Alexander Merkurjev the most. He did not write much on the board: my friend joked that he only needed to bring one paper to the class because he could copy down everything from the board in that paper. However, every word he writes must carry meaning; none is superfluous. He was clear and concise, which I found the most pleasant because everything was in perfect order, nothing more, nothing less. In fact, that is the attitude I think one should approach math, writing, or any other subject. Mozart once remarked that his favorite sound is “silence”, and in his music, he distills emotions into simple melody but profound clarity, and that is what I think a mathematician should similarly work their style on.

I audited Prof. Mario Bonk’s 245A Real Analysis for 3 weeks, but stopped going because I needed time to socialize with my fellow freshmen. He is a good lecturer though, I remember his class went up to constructing measures from premeasure, and it was highly interesting but, alas, one must make sacrifices when choosing what to study, for one’s life is short. Bonk’s other remarkable feature was his handwriting. I loved his way of writing “B” in mathcal or mathfrak, whatever it was, and his Greek letters were elegant.

The class I made the most out of was Prof. Tao's 246A complex analysis - yes, *that* professor Terry Tao. His lectures were clear, although he stuttered in many of his sentences (maybe that was because he thinks faster than he speaks?). He was a great explainer of concepts (always sketching the big picture before going into the definition, which gave me great intuition), and always visualized the concepts by repeatedly drawing on the same picture. To borrow from William Butler Yeats quote on his blog page, “Think like a wise man, but communicate in the language of people”, I think Terry lived it fully. His lectures were always easy to understand, I would simply walk into the lecture unprepared and still understand all the content. And the nature of complex analysis - marvelous results following one after another - makes his lectures like an addicting novel or television series, always making me look forward to the next lecture.  I always sat in the first row - which was usually empty because other students could not stand the invisible pressure coming from the GOAT mathematician in this age, but I somehow did not have that feeling - and I did have several interesting interactions with him. He did not like his lecture getting interrupted during class, so it was usually after class that questions were raised. One time I asked about whether there was an analogy of the generalization of the Great Picard Theorem from taking the entire complex plane as the domain to taking the domain from open sets, he answered, “I don’t know”. It struck me that Terry - a mathematician probably the most honorable and reputable in the field - would be so open to admit his ignorance to a student much junior to him. He is very humble, and I can feel that he is *truly* enjoying math, doing math for math’s sake. In my diary I noted down many times I was “inspired”, “elevated” after his lecture. Sometimes when I was low in motivation in math, his enthusiasm (very contagious) would keep me going. I once wrote “His class was more than just a class” because I learned so much from his way of approaching problems, his attitude, and his profound insights on many areas of mathematics. We went through many classical results like Cauchy’s Theorem, Cauchy Integral Formula, Residue Theorem, Riemann Mapping Theorem, just to mention a few, and we also defined objects like complex manifolds and Riemann surfaces in full generality and studied the lifting problem and the classification of Riemann surfaces (briefly), results that were not in the undergraduate complex analysis curriculum. The undergraduate complex analysis class probably covers 80% of 246A, so I think as long as one has the mathematical maturity to handle abstract concepts, 246A would be one of the most accessible introductory graduate courses and one can take it directly without taking the undergraduate version (132H). 

I think one of the most important factors that would make one a successful mathematician is to always strive for opportunities and learn as much as possible. This is especially true for an American university: if one sticks to the official schedule of mathematics one would learn nothing with his bachelor’s degree of mathematics (c.f. British universities, where there is much less flexibility but an average student will get sufficient spoon-feeding to actually know how to do math). My experience in this quarter (and Summer 2023 quarter) helped me understand how to “cheat” the system by taking harder classes (you can replace some lower division coursework with upper division coursework, effectively learning more), which I hope to illuminate future fellow math majors here if they happen to come across my post. I have also started going to math seminars and colloquiums about twice a week, listening to students presenting their reading project on a math paper (e.g. one presentation was on a proof of James Maynard’s result on the small gaps of primes related to the twin prime conjecture) or listening to postgrads attempting to describe their PhD thesis. The former I can usually follow the train of thoughts because it is less demanding in technicality, and the latter I only understand about 1%, but I still keep going to the latter because I think math must be learned in a non-linear way: getting prior exposure to concepts and abstractions as early as possible even though one has a knowledge gap in between, so one can get more comfortable with the next encounter, and also sufficient motivation to study the tool which one might have no idea what applications it might have before. And last but not least, I think these talks are also a great way to connect with the mathematical circle and understand the general trend in mathematics.
